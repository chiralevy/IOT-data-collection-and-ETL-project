Exploring the world of possbilities afforded by systems of interrelated computing devices (IoT).

Investigating the ever-expanding world of technological observation (and the consequential decrease of privacy and ephemerality), this project employs IoT technology to capture the various walks of life and analyze the effects of having unlimited access to your own past. 

The purpose of this project is to explore the concepts of privacy and memory (access to history) as they relate to our relationship with technology. Through the course of this, I hope to get closer to answering questions such as, how does the absence of privacy influence our decisions and to what extent will our actions still be genuine while someone/thing is watching? Also, will we as a society benefit from having extensive, objective records of everything that happens or will we become so caught up in the past that we forget to live in the present? How will natural human memory evolve in response to this dependency on digital logs? What about human trust?
 
Contentious questions and concepts of the like are essentially what created this project and I hope are what will inspire others on this platform to further its development in the many years to come. As an advocate of open-source technology, I am open to any suggestions as to how this project should grow structurally and philosophically.

The Entire History of You, an episode from the Black Mirror Netflix series, provided some of the ideological inspiration for creating this project. (History of You, Internet of Things, Internet of You, get it?)

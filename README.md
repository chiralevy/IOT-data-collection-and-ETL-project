# Internet-of-You
Exploring the world of possibilites afforded by systems of interrelated computing devices (IoT).

Inspired by the ever-expanding world of technological observation and the corresponding decrease of privacy/ephemerality, this project employs IoT technology to essentially capture the various walks of life and thereby empower ourselves with unlimited access to our own past. (The Entire History of You, an episode from the Black Mirror Netflix series, provided some of the ideological inspiration for creating this project. History of You, Internet of Things, Internet of You, get it?)

The purpose of this project is to explore concepts of privacy, memory, and access to the past as they relate to our relationship with technology. Salient questions driving this are likewise, how does the absence of privacy influence our decisions? Will our actions still be genuine while someone/thing is watching? Moreover, what are the implications of having this unlimited access to the past? Will we as a society benefit from having extensive, objective records of everything that happens or will we become so caught up in the past that we forget to live in the present? How will natural human memory evolve in response to this dependency on digital logs? How will human trust with one another change throughout time?
 
Contentious questions and concepts of the like are what created this project and I hope are what will inspire others on this platform to further its development in the many years to come.

As an advocate of open-source technology, I am open to any suggestions as to how this project should grow structurally and philosophically.
